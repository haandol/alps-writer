## Section 5. Design Specification

- Define the UX guidelines and page flow that will be directly reflected in MVP development.

### 5.1 User Flow and Page Structure

#### 5.1.1 Key Pages (Features)

- List the key pages that must be implemented in the MVP. (Use the same feature IDs as Section 6.1 where applicable.)

<example>
- F3: Main Screen
- F4: Post Creation Screen
- F5: Post List/Detail Screen
</example>

#### 5.1.2 Page Navigation

- Summarize how users navigate between pages and key scenarios.

<example>
1. The user accesses the main screen.
2. Sign-up/Login → Redirects to the main screen upon successful login.
3. View post list → Enter the post details screen → Create a post (Login required).
(Optional) This flow can be visualized using a Mermaid Sequence Diagram.
</example>
